# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

The initial UML includes four classes:

- Task (dataclass): holds a single care action — title, duration, priority, and category. Responsible for knowing whether it fits in a time budget (`is_doable`) and describing itself.
- Pet (dataclass): holds pet identity (name, species, age, special needs) and owns a list of Tasks. Responsible for managing and exposing its task list.
- Owner (dataclass): holds owner identity, total available minutes per day, and preferences. Responsible for managing a list of Pets.
- Scheduler: takes an Owner and a Pet, then builds an ordered daily plan (`build_plan`) and explains it in plain English (`explain_plan`). It is the only class with scheduling logic.

Relationships: Owner → Pet (one-to-many), Pet → Task (one-to-many), Scheduler uses Owner + Pet to produce a plan.

b. Design changes

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

---

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
